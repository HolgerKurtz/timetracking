# Time Tracking App with Google Calendar & Google Sheets

A free template for freelancers

With Google Calendar color labels, you can categorize events by project. This Google Apps Script allows you to export your time entries to Google Sheets, making it easy to share your tracked hours with clients.

## How to Use

1.	Assign color labels to events in Google Calendar.
2.	Copy and paste the provided Apps Script into your Google account.
3.	A new menu item will appear—click on it.
4.	Enter your details and map your calendar colors to specific projects.
5.	Import your time entries for any custom date range.

**Important Note**

Currently, Google Calendar’s API does not allow direct retrieval of custom color _label names_ (why, Google?).
As a result, you’ll need to manually map your projects in the sidebar.
